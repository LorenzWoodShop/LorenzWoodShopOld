        I make things out of wood in my free time and trade them for monitary gain.<br />
        Mainly I make smaller boxes and furniture. If you'd like to contact me for work do keep in mind that<br/>
        I generally work about 10 - 16 hours a week and take one project at a time.<br/>
        Thanks for stopping by,<br />
